# Instructions for Running and Stopping Containers Using Docker Compose

This guide will help you run the **Todolist** app using Docker Compose and set up a **MySQL** database to store your Todos.

## Step 1: Prepare the Environment

Before running the app, make sure you have the following tools installed:
- **Docker**: For building containers.
- **Docker Compose**: For orchestrating containers.

If these tools are not installed, please download them from the official website:

## Step 2: Configure Docker Compose

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**:

   If you haven't already done so, clone the repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd your-repository-directory
